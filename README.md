## The code  
This program is built in the image of an Atm machine in the real world. As a user, you may create an account, receive a unique pincode, deposit and retrieve funds from your bank account as well as being denied to use the atm if you do not have an active account and/or an expired credit card.  

## Dependencies  
* RSpec  
* IRB  

## Setup  
To test this application you need to fork it to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local workspace. Once you have cloned the repository, you will be able to:  
* Create an account in your own name
* Receive a unique pincode
* Make a deposit  
* Make a withdraw using your personal pin code  

To get started, run IRB in your local workspace. Make sure to load the following files:  
```
$ load './lib/atm.rb'  
$ load './lib/account.rb'  
$ load './lib/person.rb'  
```

## Instructions  
Once the files are loaded in IRB, get started by visiting your local Atm:  
```rb
atm = Atm.new  
```
Create your own user:  
```rb
user = Person.new(name: 'Jane Doe')  #Enter your username of choice
```

Create an account for yourself to receive your unique pincode and a card with an expiration date: 
```rb   
user.create_account  
```

Make a deposit: 
```rb
user.deposit(50) #This example deposits 50$
```

Make withdraw using your unique pin code:  
```rb 
user.withdraw(amount: 150, pin: 1234, atm: atm)  #Use the pin provided to you when creating your account
```
